# Financial Statement Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the financial statements of Organization X by calculating various financial metrics based on monthly revenue and expenses. The aim is to provide insights into the company's financial health and performance over the financial year.

## Scenario

As a Data Scientist at a consulting firm, I was tasked with assisting the auditing department in assessing Organization X's financial performance. Using the provided data, I calculated key metrics that help understand the organization's profitability and operational efficiency.


## Calculations

The following financial metrics were calculated:

1. **Profit for Each Month**: 
   Profit is calculated as the difference between revenue and expenses.
   
2. **Profit After Tax**: 
   Tax is computed at a rate of 30%, and profit after tax is calculated by subtracting tax from profit.

3. **Profit Margin**: 
   The profit margin for each month is calculated as profit after tax divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage.

4. **Good Months**: 
   Months where profit after tax exceeds the mean profit for the year.

5. **Bad Months**: 
   Months where profit after tax is below the mean profit for the year.

6. **Best Month**: 
   The month with the maximum profit after tax.

7. **Worst Month**: 
   The month with the minimum profit after tax.


## Key Learnings

1. **Financial Metrics Calculation**: Developed a strong understanding of how to calculate critical financial metrics, including profit, profit after tax, and profit margin.

2. **Python Proficiency**: Improved Python programming skills through practical implementation of loops, conditionals, and list comprehensions for data manipulation.

3. **Data Analysis**: Gained experience in analyzing financial data and deriving meaningful insights that can assist in decision-making for financial auditing.

4. **Statistical Concepts**: Enhanced knowledge of statistical measures such as mean and its application in business contexts to evaluate performance over time.

5. **Conversion of Units**: Learned how to convert financial figures into more manageable units (thousands) for easier interpretation and presentation.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Organization X's financial performance over the year, highlighting profitable months and identifying areas for improvement. The insights gained can support financial decision-making and strategic planning.
